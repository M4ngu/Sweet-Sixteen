## Sweet_3

derived for the 16n 2.0.1  

midiCC, midi channels and master i2c settings can be done in the web editor so compiling your own firmware is not necessary, just download the HEX and flash it with the Teensy loader

changes:
  
  channel numbers are not reversed if the 'rotate' is active
  
  calibration of the high value is now possible when the 'rotate' is active

  allow the use of pitchBend ( by selecting midiCC 127 )
  
  added support for GESS ( Gate Expander for Sweet Sixteen ) makes midi notes with gates/buttons
  
    About the GESS feature:
    
    -every button/gate in will create a midi note in the TRS & USB midi outs
    
    -the pitch and velocity can be a fixed value or CV controlled (upper 8 faders & CV inputs for note value, lower 
    row of fader & CV for velocity)
    
    -8 presets
    
    -press the function button (next the USB port) to activate the 'load preset', any of the 8 buttons will load it.
    
    -press the function button while pressing any of the 8 GESS buttons will save a preset, the position of the 
    faders will determine the preset values (upper row for pitch, lower row  for velocity) and if any of the faders
    is at minimum position, then that value would be read in real time. So if you save a preset with the fader 2 & 9 
    fully down, the midi notes generated by gates in the GESS input 2 will be controlled by the fader & CV 2, and the
    velocity of the notes generated by the gate input 1 will be CV controlled by fader & CV 9. None of those faders 
    will send the usual midiCC while being used for midi note or velocity.
