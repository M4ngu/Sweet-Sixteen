## Sweet_mkII

derived from the 16n v1.34 firmware, 

changes:

  allow the use of pitchBend
  
  added boot-up delay
  
  added midi note creation with GESS ( Gate Expander for Sweet Sixteen )
  
    About the GESS feature:
    
    -every button/gate in will create a midi note in the TRS midi out
    
    -the pitch and velocity can be a fixed value or CV controlled (upper 8 faders & CV inputs for note value, lower row of fader & inputs for velocity)
    
    -8 presets
    
    -press the function button (next the USB port) will activate the 'load preset', any of the 8 buttons will load it.
    
    -press the function button while pressing any of the 8 GESS buttons will save a preset, the position of the faders will determine the preset values (upper row pitch, lower row velocity) and if at minimum then that value would be read in real time. So if you save a preset with the fader 2 & 9 fully down, the midi note generated by gate signlas in the input 2 will be controlled by the fader 2 (and the CV in 2) and the velocity of the note generated by the gate input 2 will be CV controlled by fader & CV in 9.
