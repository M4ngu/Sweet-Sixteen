If you want to order boards make sure you have a valid replacement for the faders, the ones I use have a weird pinout. You can also edit the board in order to use your desired fader model.

The voltage range could be modified by replacing The voltage range of the faders can by easy modified by replacing the IC4 for another LDO and changing the value of the summing resistors in the MCP6004 circuits,
